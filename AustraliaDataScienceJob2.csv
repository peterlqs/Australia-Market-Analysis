Work with a world-leading, independent medical research institute
Located in Westmead—Sydney’s and Australia’s foremost biomedical research precinct
Children’s Medical Research Institute (CMRI) was Australia’s first dedicated paediatric research facility and is now one of the world’s most highly regarded independent medical research organisations. Our research focuses on the four key areas impacting children’s health: cancer, genomics and genetic diseases, neurobiology, and embryology. Our strong international reputation is based on decades of significant research outcomes in these areas of specialty. CMRI is also home to the world-first proteomics project, ProCan, which is changing the way cancer is diagnosed and treated. CMRI’s research programs are supported by state of the art facilities and committed research and support staff. Our achievements are made possible by a loyal network of community supporters, highly engaged donors, and the very successful Jeans for Genes® and Great Cycle Challenge fundraising campaigns.
A bioinformatician position is available in the ProCan Cancer Data Science (CDS) Group, led by Dr. Qing Zhong. ProCan (the ACRF International Centre for the Proteome of Human Cancer) is a world-first initiative developed and launched in September 2016 by Professors Phil Robinson and Roger Reddel, and established with a $10 million grant from the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF). Equipped with six SCIEX mass spectrometers and a supercomputer (800TB / 480 cores), ProCan processes tumour samples through a proteomic method, DIA-MS, which allows fast mass spectrometric conversion of small amounts of tissue (biopsy level) into a single, permanent digital file representing the quantitative proteome of the sample. One of the goals of ProCan is to measure proteins in tens of thousands of cancers of all types with known treatment outcome and correlate tumour proteotypes with clinical phenotypes. The Cancer Data Science Group aims to develop novel computational tools and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to achieve this goal. Other major focuses of the group are 1) big proteogenomic data mining and management, 2) the genome-proteome association analysis and multi-omic data integration for studying cancer, 3) development of advanced statistical tools to account for batch effects caused by large-scale, high throughput proteomics, and 4) implementation of big data-driven, evidence-based computational tools to achieve predictive, preventive, personalized medicine.
We invite applications from PhD scientists to join our group. Applicants should be experienced data scientists with a high degree of motivation in academic research, an excellent record of scientific accomplishments with publications in peer-reviewed journals, and the ability to work independently with outstanding communication and writing skills.

The Opportunity
Enhance your PhD studies and kickstart your research career with a CSIRO AI for Missions PhD scholarship
Work alongside leading data scientists and engineers in real life projects aimed at solving Australia’s biggest challenges.
Our scholarship students are the next generation research leaders in data science who progress to a diverse range of careers in industry, research and academia

CSIRO has invested $25M over four years in the AI for Missions Program to create novel AI research and technologies that will enable Missions to solve Australia’s greatest challenges. To deliver on this goal we will partner with universities and industry to advance the science, technology and impact of AI to support Missions.


We are inviting applications for the AI for Missions PhD scholarship program for the project ‘Identification of environmental risk factors for antimicrobial resistance using spatio-temporal statistical models.’ We are looking for diverse and creative scholars, who can demonstrate academic and research excellence, and are capable of driving our impactful research projects that help shape Australia’s digital future. Students will have the opportunity to be part of a cohort and participate in the coursework program offered by the Next Generation Graduates Programs. Our previous scholarship recipients are successfully employed in the industry, technology companies and SMEs, universities, and leading research institutes in Australia and around the globe. Our graduates complete the program with a lifelong connection to CSIRO through our alumni network.
For this project, experience in the application of Bayesian spatio-temporal statistical models (ideally) in an environmental domain and a first class honours degree in statistics or data analytics will be highly regarded.
Project Description:
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global threat. The least-well understood component of the one-health perspective to AMR is the role that the environmental component plays in eventual clinical presentations of AMR. This project proposes a statistical approach that will be applied to a specific freshwater case, but in a way that can be readily generalised to other marine or freshwater applications or case studies. In particular, the project will identify generalisable (surrogate) AMR markers and use them as response variable(s) in a spatio-temporal model that can identify the effect of environmental covariates using observations with point (such as water quality) or areal (such as land use) characteristics.
Project Supervisors:
Keith Hayes, CSIRO, keith.hayes@csiro.au
Erica Donner, University of South Australia, erica.donner@unisa.edu.au


Location: Adelaide or Hobart - the students are expected to spend more than 50% of their time based in CSIRO.

Your new role

An exciting opportunity exists for a Research Fellow to join the Curtin School of Allied Health working with the enAble Institute. The successful candidate will work with Associate Prof. Melanie Ferguson on the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funded project: Empowering adults with hearing loss by increasing informed choice, accessibility, and uptake of hearing healthcare.

The Problem
Four million Australians have hearing loss. Yet many do not seek help and are unaware of the hearing healthcare options that are available. This leads to many people not obtaining the hearing healthcare they need.

Our Solution
We will co-create a tailored online decision aid to explain the pros and cons of available hearing health options. We anticipate this approach to decision-making will increase uptake of hearing healthcare and improve the lives of many adults with hearing loss.
