# Project: Australia Data Science Job Market Analysis
This project analyzes the Australian data science job market using a dataset of job listings from Glassdoor. The dataset contains information on the job title, company size, industry, location, and estimated base salary.

## Purpose of the project
The project answers the following questions:
- Which cities have the highest number of data job listings?
- What sectors are hiring for data roles?
- Do larger companies offer higher salary estimates for data analytics/science positions compared to smaller companies?
- Are there significant salary variations based on the location and sector?
- Predict the base salary.
- Segment the estimated base salary into groups to identify patterns. 
## Conclusion of the analysis
The Australian data science job market is growing rapidly. Sydney and Melbourne are the best cities to find data science jobs, and the finance, information technology, and management consulting sectors are the most in demand. Companies with 1000 to 5000 employees generally offer higher salaries than smaller companies.
### Side note
This project is a final portfolio assignment for the COMP2200: Data Science course at Macquarie University.
